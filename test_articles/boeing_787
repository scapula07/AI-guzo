Next month will mark some 14 years since Boeing's fourth prototype for its modern 787 'Dreamliner' widebody family took to the skies for the first time. Registered as N7874, it has undertaken a significant amount of testbed flying for the US-based manufacturer and remains active in this role today. Let's take a look back at some of its most notable tasks, which have varied considerably over the years. 12 years of flight According to data made available on the ATDB.aero database, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000-powered N7874 was built in September 2009, around three months before the Boeing 787's first flight. However, as the fourth prototype of the short-fuselage 787-8 variant, this particular aircraft didn't hit the skies until the following year, with ch-aviation noting that this took place on February 24th, 2010. This aircraft type has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 227,930 kg, equivalent to 502,500 pounds. N7874 represents a pivotal point in the Dreamlimer's story, as it was the penultimate 787 testbed built by Boeing, followed only by N787FT. After this, 787s with Construction Numbers 6 and up were made for use by Boeing's commercial customers, such as airlines and government operators. However, what sets N7874 apart from its other Boeing 787 Dreamliner prototype counterparts is that it has remained active for a far longer period than the rest. Indeed, data accessed via ch-aviation shows that this particular aircraft is the only one of the five not to have been scrapped (N787FT) or put on display (N787BA, N787EX, and N787BX). Over its career, it has served various exciting roles.  The second ecoDemonstrator The photograph below depicts N7874 during its tenure as a Boeing' ecoDemonstrator' aircraft. This term refers to experimental planes that Boeing uses to trial a range of technological features, aiming to increase its aircraft's operational sustainability. Simple Flying had the chance to see a Boeing 737 MAX serving as one in Glasgow in 2021, as well as 2022's 777-00ER iteration in Seattle. As far as N7874's period in this role was concerned, Boeing notes that it tested "more than 25 new technologies aimed at improving aviation's environmental performance through every phase of flight." These included greenhouse gas sensors, real-time turbulence reports, and remote sensors to reduce wiring, with its first ecoDemonstrator flight occurring in 2014. Boeing's Ray Conner stated that:
